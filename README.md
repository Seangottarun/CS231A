# CS231A

This repository contains my LaTeX notes and assignment solutions to Stanford's CS231A Computer Vision: From 3D Reconstruction to Recognition.

These notes are by no means a replacement for going through the actual material. They just contain points that I found interesting or important.

If you find anything that needs to be fixed or can be improved, please let me know!

**Full Disclosure:** I am not a student at Stanford so I've been learning the course material
by reading the slides online, students' notes, and the textbooks.

**Status:** In progress ðŸš§
